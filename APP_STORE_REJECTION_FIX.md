## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Crash on Launch - FIXED

**Root Cause:** Circular Provider dependencies during initialization

**Solution:**
- Replaced `ChangeNotifierProvider` with `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` for dependent services
- Proper dependency injection order:
  ```dart
  // Independent providers first
  ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => ThemeService()),
  ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => EnhancedAuthService()),
  ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => FlowIQSyncService()),
  
  // Dependent providers using ProxyProvider
  ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<FlowIQSyncService, HealthDiagnosisService>(...),
  ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<FlowIQSyncService, EnhancedAIService>(...),
  // etc.
  ```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/main.dart` - Provider initialization logic

**Testing:**
- ✅ Built release IPA successfully
- ✅ No crashes on iOS simulators
- ✅ All services initialize correctly

---

### ✅ 2. App Naming - FIXED

**Issue:** Inconsistent naming between "Flow Ai" and "Flow iQ"

**Changes:**
- `CFBundleDisplayName`: "Flow Ai" → "Flow iQ"
- `CFBundleName`: "flow_ai" → "Flow iQ"
- All permission descriptions updated to "Flow iQ"
- Removed invalid `background-fetch` from UIBackgroundModes

**Files Modified:**
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
